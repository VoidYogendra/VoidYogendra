- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vulkan and OPENGL-ES and onnx runtime.
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** Iâ€™m not scared of losing 100 times to get 1 win â€” Iâ€™m scared of stopping at 99.

## ðŸš€ Projects in Progress

> Building the toolbox that actually belongs in the future â€” GPU-first, native performance, no bloat.

- [ ] **Hand Gesture Calculator**  
  _MediaPipe + OpenGL ES_  
  - Real-time hand landmark detection with MediaPipe  
  - Custom GLSL shaders for UI overlay and gesture visualization
